       " 'Best of The Frog chain of British-style pubs in France (also in one of the prettiest parts of France, Bércy).\\n\\nThe Frog at Bércy Village is located very close to Bércy underground station (about a 1 minute walk). Bércy Village, actually, is a short secluded lane with restaurants and shops on either side, not really a village after all. Bércy is the actual quartier. Close by is one of the many wonderful France attractions, La Cinémathéque Francaise (see my review). One more reason to go there.\\n\\nThe Frog Bércy is the prettiest of a chain of 4 British-style Pubs in central France, it\\'s also a microbrewery. Their ales are British style (IPA, best bitter, stout - plus a Hoegaarden like lemony ale), and of very good quality. Admittedly, the prices for these beers are € 5 and up, so effectively even more expensive than in London. But then, France is the rip-off to end all other rip-offs, and beer prices can go up to € 10 for 500ml (not even a pint!). € 5 per glass are called \"happy hour\" around here! It\\'s not even a tourist rip-off, because the French are always happy to rip off their own countrymen, too, in one fell swoop.\\n\\nI had a couple of fine real ales there and fish and chips (what else!). The portion wasn\\'t huge, but to compensate for that, it was small. The fish was of excellent quality, crisp, with a good bite and firm texture - the chips were a bit flabby, just like the ones you get at many British pubs. Home, sweet [spiritual] home. ;)\\n\\nThe decor is very pleasant indeed, and emphasizes the \"dual\" British-French nature of the pub. Despite the slightly inflated prices, the pub is extremely busy at lunch *and* dinner times. Well, it\\'s a nice neighborhood after all.\\n\\nService is decidedly French, i.e. a bit snooty, generally inefficient and a tad slow. It\\'s all part of the folklore, isn\\'t it?',\n",

Ordered up the fish and chips, and they were the best fish and chips I have ever had!  We both agreed, this was the best food we had while we were in France. It was so good, that we went back again the next night for dinner.  \\n\\nThe other cool thing about this place, is that they have microbrews.  Now, where I come from, beer is a religion.  I am not a beer drinker, but my husband is and he brews his own.  Frogs has a great brewery set up and from what I heard, really good beer. \\n\\nSo, if you want great fish and chips and an excellent beer - go here... you won't be disappointed!\",\n",

The waiters and waitresses are extremely busy but always have time for you and are always smiling and polite. One dark haired waitress had the type of smile that super models would die for! We didn't have to wait long for food. We had 2 x nachos for starters - excellent, good to see them being served with jalapeños as well- and 4 x various burgers ( inc. veggie ) for main meals. Again, could not fault these either. Basically, had a very good night at The Frog.\\n\\nBeers, excellent and there was a really good choice.\\n\\nDon't expect Bistro type drinks or food as this, as mentioned earlier, is a French type of Wetherspoons. The main difference though is excellent waiters, better beers, better food , better clientele and a superior atmosphere. No rowdiness, bad language or obese underdressed hen party- goers. Funny how they can get it right in the continent? The place is huge yet we never felt crowded. If in Bercy Village then The Frog has to be a must try place. Highly recommended is The Frog.

We looked at the sweet menu and on another day we would have sampled something but we were both full l finished with a cappuccino and we were presented with a lovely mixture of small petit fours which was lovely \\nThere’s a cracking chef in this establishment with a great team round about him keep up the good work guys 10 out of 10 if your in Rome don’t leave without trying this restaurant a culinary experience',\n",
       " 'The restaurant atmosphere was relaxing and beautiful. The food was amazing. I highly recommend the wine and truffle tasting menu.

Later, they sent a thank you email with a cookbook attached. Fantastic experience!',\n",

Presentation is amazing, and lots of nice touches like the amuse-bouche and their own breads and petit fours.\\nThe wine list is the best I’ve ever seen!! So much choice. \\nService is excellent, friendly and efficient. They made it a special night for me by bringing out a cake at the end and singing Happy Birthday to me!! \\nWhen we’re back in Rome, we’ll definitely be eating here again!',\n",

Excellent service and really nice food with great selection of the first materials. \\n\\nThe extra virgin olive oil made the difference and was surprisingly offered as a gift at the end of our meal. \\nTotally recommend it for couples or special occasions.\\n\\nThe most important was the fact that there wasn’t a hurry to leave the table so as to replace you with other clients. They gave you time to decide and enjoy your meal. \\n\\nAn atmospheric experience in the heart of Rome',\n",

       " \"As you walk in you immediately notice hundreds of wine bottles around the walls, some fixed to the walls and some loose. At first it appears to be a cosy little restaurant but it's bigger than you think. Just after 8 it suddenly filled and not a single table remained empty. Not bad on a street which was full of nothing but restaurants. The general ambience was lovely,  buzzing conversation and nice lighting.  The staff were really friendly and even though busy, took the time to chat. Free glass of prosecco on arrival and a plate of petit fours at the end. The food itself was well cooked and presented.  I can highly recommend the cod starter. We shared a lobster spaghetti which was served up in 2 smaller portions and they allow you to have a couple of small portion mains like a tasting menu.  I had the beef fillet and the suckling pig. Both delicious. We marked down a bit because the Mrs had 2 dishes which were a bit dry and needed a sauce of some kind to make it more enjoyable.  Though we did put this on the feedback card they provided at the end. So a good 4.5 out of 5 and we would certainly recommend and return.\",\n",

However, we really liked what we saw, so we booked a table for the day after and we are very glad we did it.\\nThat was an emazing night. We were surprised by the great service and an even better food and wine experience. \\nWe spent 16 days travelling around Italy, mainly in Toscana, tasting all kind of italian dishes. However, the Ad Hoc night was our better food experience during the entire trip.\",\n",

       " 'One word “Excellent”. The tasting menu, which was white and black truffle based was astounding. The all women front of house knew their menus and wines.. what a selection. I hope that Thomas Keller, whom Chef Paul Bocuse on behalf-of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, presented to Keller as a Chevalier of The French Legion of Honor in 2011 in recognition of his lifelong commitment to the traditions of French cuisine and his role in elevating cooking in America; will open in London.',\n",

From the first greeting, the servers (who actually put a candle in my wife's dessert and sang Happy Birthday to her), to the cheerful good bye the service was 5 star.  We had two different tasting menus - both delicious.  The execution of each dish was perfect.  The wine pairings were spot on.  If you find yourself in Rome you should absolutely go to Ad Hoc for a great experience.\",\n",

We were given a call ahead of time, letting us know that the electricity was out but they would still be able to accommodate us. We arrived to a cavernous but cozy room aglow with candles. Our waiter was apologetic, but it was the most beautiful sight. The service was fantastic and the food was other worldly. We loved it so much.

We walked to the restaurant from Babuino 181 hotel.  A short walk in a good area.\\n\\nWe arrived a bit early but they seated us immediately without a problem.  The restaurant is small, perhaps intimate is a better description but the table spacing and layout give each party ample privacy.  The decor is nice too.  It is essentially a wine cellar atmosphere with the restaurants wine selection surrounding the room on shelves with led lights.  \\n\\nWe ordered the Roman style cuisine tasting menu with the corresponding wine offer.  I though we would be selecting one item from each course but the menu includes everything.  We really enjoyed all of the food and all of the wine with one exception.

At the end of the dinner we we were presented with a special anniversary bottle of prosecco and an Ad Hoc labeled bottle of olive oil. \\nThe lovely experience continued after we returned home, with a mini restaurant e-cookbook arriving via email a few weeks after our visit. \\nHighly recommend and definitely will return to this restaurant on our next visit to Rome.\",\n",

Service was exceptional, and presentation was as well.  The pumpkin blossoms and roulade in phyllo dough were great starters.  The special was a cake of veal and lamb that was simply outstanding, as was the sea bass and spaghetti.  They have a variety of truffles that can be added to any dish, which makes it a very unique experience.  The banana gelato was a perfect end to the meal as well!\",\n",

The service is great, the waiters know the menu perfectly and make good recommendations. The wine list is the best I’ve ever seen. More than 200 pages, I think, of high quality Italian wine. And the restaurant specialises in truffles. They have tasting menus and special truffle menu from which we ordered. Everything was amazing!',\n",

       " 'My wife, daughter and I had a wonderful meal at Ad Hoc.  A friend recommended the resturant, and it certainly lived up to the recommendation.  When we went, the resturant had a special truffle menu — which we all ordered from.  It was simply delicious!  Even better — when we mentioned to the manager we were looking for a good resturant for cacio a pepe — it was not on the menu — she went to the kitchen and whipped up an order.  It was amazingly good.  Although we were stuffed, we topped it off with a special chocolate dessert.  As to wine, we let the sommelier pick for us and she did an outstanding job.  When in Rome .. eat at Ad Hoc!',\n",
       " 'We liked everything about it: the food & wine, the understated elegance, the service. \\nWe indulged in some white truffles, currently in season. The sommelier was up to par, especially since Italian wines are not my strong suit. \\nReserve early, this restaurant is in high demand.',\n",

       " \"I booked Ad Hoc after reading some positive reviews and some reviews referring to birthday meals. We were in Rome for a wedding but it coincided with my girlfriend's birthday so I was on the look out for a good restaurant for that night. Booking from the UK was easy and the communication was good, I was e-mailed asking if I want to pre-order a dessert as I had mentioned it was for my girlfriend's birthday. The day before the booking I received a call to confirm and when we arrived we were warmly welcomed and taken to our seat, which seemed to be the best table in the restaurant in my opinion, and we had a complimentary glass of sparkling wine each. Our host and all the waitresses were absolutely brilliant, so attentive and really knew the menu inside out. When each dish was brought out we were given detailed descriptions. We were given a complimentary starter which was delicious and we all ordered something different, so the sommelier helped us pair a good wine to the dishes. All the courses were incredible, for me the Pasta with truffles was brilliant, this was a starter on the night, and the Suckling pig was so nice. At the end of the meal the lights went out and the waitresses sang happy birthday to my girlfriend and brought out the tiramisu that I pre-ordered. After the dessert we got yet another complimentary dessert selection of home made biscuits and then just before we left a bottle of Ad Hoc's olive oil, which we had during our starter and loved, so this was a lovely touch. \\n\\nOverall unbelievably brilliant service, fantastic food and drink, can't recommend highly enough. If I go to Rome again I will defiantly be coming back\",\n",
       " \"Truly an experience to enjoy.  Right up there with the best restaurants in the world with one complaint.  The desserts were not up the the level of the rest of the meal at all.  However, don't let that put you off.  The rest of the meal was so outstanding that I could not mark them down for being disappointed in the dessert course. Go, enjoy and hope they improve dessert.  We come here every time we are in Rome.\",\n",

The staff are extremely hard working and everyone seems to help out so we didn’t have the same waitress the whole night but they were all equally pleasant and professional. \\n\\nThe food was divine however even with such small tasters you start to feel quite full by the time the desserts arrive and it’s a really interesting way to try new things and enjoy different Italian wines.  Including a small appetiser there are 6 lovely courses to get through.  Bread served on the side is also varied and tasty but it can fill you up.\\n\\nThis is not somewhere you would eat regularly but it is wonderful for a special occasion.',\n",

       " 'I’ve read the negative reviews and our experience could not have been more pleasant. Albeit the tasting menu takes approximately 1-1.5 hours but that is part of the experience. The food and wine pairing were amazing and surprisingly we both left feeling more than satisfied in terms of the amount of food we ate.

Lots of little extras, food was good but if I return to Rome and go there again wouldn’t have tasting menu as far too much food. Really good value for money and worth a visit but need to book.',\n",

And at 250 euro for four, a good portion of which was for wine, we think good value. Happily adding this to our personal list of top global restaurants.',\n",
       " 'We ate here in late June while visiting Rome. Reservation for 4 at 20:00. Everything was wonderful - absolutely wonderful. The staff was beyond accommodating and made us feel as though we were the only ones in the restaurant. We all ordered the tasting menu (no pressure at all from the staff) - 3 with wine, 1 without. We were able to make substitutions between the tasting menus to satisfy our cuisine preferences. Portions were very fair - both food and wine. No skimping. Wine was well paired (and generously poured) and the food was simply delicious.  Can’t wait to go back!',\n",
       " \"We are a family of foodies and this night we where celebrating the birthdays of our daughters. We decided to go to this well received restaurant. The service was warm and personal and they spent time to assist and discuss different wine pairings throughout the evening. Great! The choice of wines are very good and the walls are being used as wine storage. \\nThe aim of the restaurant was be perceived as a high end traditional Italian restaurant in a fine dining wrapping (complementary  dishes, service, attention to all details). They succeeded very well being developing a warm, personal atmosphere with fantastic dishes. The pasta was in our opinion the best we have had at a restaurant in our lives! If they want to be more fine dining there are details to be refined (smaller portions, more structured service and attention to details. ) Don't interpret me wrong. The place is fantastic and the service and atmosphere is what we want in Italy. The wines tasted was a Nebbiolo from Valtellina and a great Etna Rosso!. Well matched to the dishes.\\nSmall notes to be refined- Given the quality of the wines they need to be chilled before served. Now they were served in the same temperature (approx 25 degrees). A few minutes in a wine cooler (also for the reds) are recommended.\\n\\nCan highly recommend Ad Hoc\",\n",
       " \"Ad Hoc was excellent in terms of atmosphere, food, and service. Been there for dinner with wife and from the beginning, we felt really good and relaxed. The restaurant decor is really nice (bottle of wines on the shelfs and walls) and makes feel comfy and give you that feeling that you're in a nice restaurant   Staff was very helpful and informative, explain the menu in details and also they knew their food and wine. Food is really good but for my taste, the truffle dishes are a bit overpowered by truffle which is very fresh and intensive but that's only our opinion. Food presentation was really good, well-executed and really tasty. In the end, we pay 180 euros which I believe it was a fair price for the whole experience we also get two boxes of sweets and complementary Ad Hoc olive oil. That was a nice touch for our dinner. Generally well worth it to go why you in Rome especially for romantic dinner.\",\n",

The staff were all very friendly from when we walked into the restaurant to when we said goodbye.  They made us feel welcome, and were happy to answer all of our questions.  The food was fabulous, from the appetizers to the dessert.  I had the sea bass which was exquisite, and the pasta was fresh, homemade and delicious.  They had an excellent variety of Italian wines at reasonable prices.  One of my colleagues is going to Rome in August, and Ad Hoc is the only restaurant that I recommended to her.  It's a must for any trip to Rome.\",\n",

They started us off with complimentary wine, bread, olive oil, balsamic. I think we ate 4 or 5 courses of food.  We had more wine and complimentary dessert as well.  They gave us a small bottle of their olive oil. Each course was delicious.  What's even better... It was only $40 US!  I would go here again and again.  Sooo good.  You will not leave hungry!\",\n",
       " \"The warm and welcoming vibe hooks you up from the moment you sit at the table. Staff is very friendly and tries to keep your happy all the time, although sometimes the service is a bit slow (it didn't ruin our experience at all - just be aware). The food is great. We were lucky to visit the place during annual truffles festival, so all dishes had an option to be lifted up with few slices of black truffle (yummy!!!). The basket with flavored breads selection was a nice touch. And the wine list (more like an endless scroll) served its purpose well. From the food I would recommend Carbonara al cubo and Guancia  Manzo Tartufo.\",\n",

We opted for the taster menu with wine selection to accompany the food. Well the food was absolutely amazing! I lost count of the amount of food brought to our table over 5 or 6 courses. We thought the wine might be small but we were wrong. The wines brougt to us were in quite sizable glasses so a very good quantity was served. And each piece of food or wine brought to us was described in terms of where it came from by the knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff.

The food was excellent, and everyone in our group said it was the best dining experience they had ever had! The wines were excellent too, and again, we could change them if needed. “Roma” explained in great detail about every food dish and the accompanying wine served with them. Which vineyard they came from and the grape used. \\n\\nWe were initially going to go to Harry’s Bar, as I have visited there many times before when in Rome.

It started with pumpkin blossoms with ricotta and truffles.  For primo, tonnarelli pasta with butter, parmesan and truffles.  For the main course I chose the braised beef cheeks with truffles.  This was followed by a selection of desserts.  The wine pairings were just right, and I was particularly pleased with the Amarone served with the beef.

It took us a very long time to choose what to eat as there was such a choice but in the end we went for one of the tasting menus with matching wines and every single bit of food on our plates was delicious, especially the truffled pasta.

There's a few tasting menu options (one dedicated to truffles!) Or you can order each course from the normal menu. Servers were all really friendly and can help choose the wine (there is a huge book to choice from!) And there's a few little nice surprises as well just to top off the experience.

I e-mailed the restaurant to alert them to an allergy that my step sons have and when we arrived, everyone was aware of the allergy and they extremely accommodating with the menu and the service was great throughout dinner. Now, on to the food - unbelievable! I knew I loved truffle, but this was beyond my expectations - truffle EVERYTHING, you can literally have everything on the menu with truffle. I loved the truffle so much that I even tried to make another reservation for a free night we had a few days later, but unfortunately they were fully booked. I can't say enough great things, the staff was great, the restaurant itself was beautiful, the wine selection was excellent and the food was amazing!\",\n",

We were very happy with our choices as they were so very tasty and the portion size was just right. \\n\\nUpon requesting the bill, the waitress said she would be a few minutes. Upon her return she cam back with a chocolate and cream dessert with a candle in it singing happy birthday  - much to the embarrassment of my girlfriend!

The price is fair considering the food quality and the overall dining experience. I'd love to come back if there is a chance :)\",\n",

The waitress even indulged my pathetic attempts at Italian and gave me both menus so i could cheat if needed!  The food is really lovely here - very imaginatively presented.  We didn't go with the tasting menu but chose from the a la carte which had something for everyone. The complimentary prosecco on arrival was a lovely touch and we got some great tips for our wine selection.  The service was extremely professional but warm at the same time. The bill was very reasonable for the quality and overall experience.  The gift of a bottle of olive oil when we left was a big but very welcome surprise.  You should try this restaurant!\",\n",

       " \"I had searched through many restaurants for my husband's perfect birthday dinner.  When we arrived in Rome our concierge said that we should enjoy Ad Hoc but it wasn't necessarily a celebration venue.  I completely disagree!  The small, intimate restaurant designed its seating so that there is more privacy in certain sections than at many Roman restaurants.  The wine bottles lining the room make one feel like you have been invited to dine in a family's private cellar.  For fans of truffles, that is their speciality, and they do no it well.  The carbonara cubo was so good that my husband stole it and left me with his pasta course, which fortunately for me, was also excellent.  The lamb dish on special was exquisite, but the beef cheeks were also a magnificent choice.  My husband was also touched that the chef did also gift him with a special dessert in honour of his birthday.  The restaurant is on a quiet street and is completely walkable from several fine hotels, and it was open on a Sunday.\",\n",
       " \"This was a wonderful dining experience. Upon arrival, we were shown to a private booth for our family of four and offered a complimentary glass of prosecco.  While the multi-course meal was delicious, what we appreciated most was how the staff bent over backward to accommodate our daughter, who is vegan. It's not easy finding vegan meals in Rome (aside from the ubiquitous past in red sauce), but here the chef offered numerous options for her and she loved them all (and the rest of us loved our cheese and meat courses). To top off this very satisfying meal, we were each offered a small bottle of olive oil as a parting gift.  Prices were very reasonable as well. It was a memorable experience and we will be sure to visit Ad Hoc on future trips to Rome.\",\n",

We were fairly loud for such a sophisticated restaurant but the staff were accommodating.  Most of the party had one of the tasting menus and the food was extremely tasty, the helpings defeated some of the party and the wine choices complimented each course.  I hope we get the chance to return in a couple of years but maybe I should ask for a private room.',\n",

Even though the restaurant was almost full, we experienced a sense of tranquility and waiters were not 'pushing' you to order or to clear a table. To call the wine list 'extensive' is an understatement: it's (Trump-voice) HUGE! The staff have excellent knowledge of wine, grappa etc. At midnight was the birthday of my partner and the Ad Hoc team made it a special moment in a classy way! The spaces are cozy, wine bottles are wall-to-ceiling and the decor is simple yet elegant but COZY. The food was good but what really makes Ad Hoc stand out is the EXPERIENCE.

We were sat at a window-side table where we could watch people passing by and admiring the beauty of the decor inside the restaurant. It made us feel very fancy! We were pleasantly assisted in selecting one of the best wines we had during our entire honeymoon trip. Then we proceeded to enjoy one of the best meals of the trip as well! Not only was the food extremely delicious but the ambiance, the welcoming staff and the surprise \"Happy Honeymoon!\" dessert plate at the end really made it nothing short of a special and memorable meal.

It was a wonderful, relaxed night in a cosy warm restaurant and I would recommend it to anyone . The only thing we both would have changed is that our table for two was tucked behind a wall.

The witress also deserves a special mention for really good knowledge of all the food and wine and explanation of each when brought to the table (in english).

For 250 euro a couple for a prix fixe\\nMenu, You'd expect to be blown away, and honestly, I was not. \\nI had the black truffle menu, usually a solid choice. We started off with slow service and an amuse bouch that was a tasteless spinach purée. The carbonara continues to be as good as it gets, but a lot of the truffles were flat and fairly weak. The wine pairings were good with 3 out of 4 being stunning. The wine steward is great and she took the time to explain all the selections. The rest of the food was okay, and the suckling pig was a winner. There were three rounds of deserts, but I was too stuffed to really plow through them. The prix fixe came with a conolli that was great, a pannacotta that was blah and a good tiramisu that has somehow become a standard on all Roman restaurant menus. \\nService was choppy and once the high rollers began ordering truly expensive wines, they garnered all the attention. It was just not the friendly and personal experience that I have been accustomed to, and the evening was a bit of a let down. \\nWould I go back? That remains to be seen.\",\n",

I really wanted to try the different tastes and textures of fried, steamed, and combinations.  Became a huge fan of the Uzbek. Khanum after eating here.',\n",
       " 'Pretty good service. As a fan of dumplings, i would recommend you to have a try here. It provides different types of dumplings, including russian, italian, chinese and japanese style. I tried the khanum with eggplant. It was really good!!',\n",
       " 'Good food. Not too expensive.  The Russian pilmeni are good and authentic. Prices are average. Also had the herring and potatoes and enjoyed.',\n",
       " 'One of the best pelmeni I have tried in the Baltic area. Nothing very complicated, nice modern decorations. Simple food choices, good quality, mid range prices. Close to the faberge museum, while waiting for a tour.',\n",
       " 'Amazing selection of dumplings, and sated my Siberian craving for Pelmeni and Altai vodka!  Nice contemporary setting and fantastic service.  Savoury and sweet dumplings, and Grimbergen on tap.  Delicious.  Would it be too cheeky to ask for them to add Polish pierogies?',\n",
       " \"Extensive dumpling menu, all very well prepared. Service is excellent. \\n\\nDon't fancy dumplings, try elsewhere, but for their mono - cuisine you'll struggle to find better :-)\",\n",
       " 'Great place for those who like or are willing to try traditional Russian food pelmeni (dumplings). Menu also contains all variations of dumplings from over the world: ravioli, dim sum, gyoza, vareniki, manti and khinkali. All of the dumplings are freshly handmade The fact that you can chose how many pieces you are getting in each serving allows to try a few different things in one go. Food is simple but delicious and great value for money.\\nPleasant atmosphere, service is quick waiters are friendly and english speaking. Plus few wi-fi is available.\\nDefiantly going back next time I am in St. Pete:)',\n",
       " 'I came here with my daughter and we just loved it. We devoured the vareniki with potato and the prawn gouza. Both were as fantastic as we make at home in australia.  We loved is much we came back on our last night in st petersburg',\n",
       " 'Whilst I would not recommend this eatery for dinner, it makes a perfect pit stop for a hearty, cheap and filling lunch. No one should visit this part of the world without trying dumplings, meat or vegetables encased in an unleavened dough which are then boiled (and sometimes fried). They are a historic food staple and cherished part of the Russian and Central Asian diet. At Pelmenya you can experiment with a variety of dumplings including the famous Russian pelmeni, but also Ukrainian vareniki, Georgian khinkali, Uzbek manti, and also Chinese dim sum and Italian ravioli. \\n\\nWe naturally tried pelmeni, resembling tortellini stuffed with ground beef and then boiled; vareniki, crescent shaped crimped parcels containing mashed potato and boiled;  khinkali, large purse shaped spicy dumplings stuffed with pork and beef, boiled and then fried that contain a mouthwatering savoury broth, and manti, containing spicy minced lamb that are boiled. Other fillings, both savoury and sweet, are available. Our choices came with a variety of condiments, including fried onions and sour cream, all except the khinkali which are supposed to be consumed plain and without the use of knives or forks; you should eat them with your hands leaving just the ‘stalk’ or ‘kudi’ of the dumpling where the pleats meet, which is tough. We particularly liked the fact that you could chose how many pieces of each dumpling to try (you’d want rather more pelmeni than khinkali), and the menu was in English as well as Russian. \\n\\nThe waiting staff were very helpful and pleasant and spoke good English, the restaurant has a hip, modern vibe with free WiFi, although I would not want to sit for long on the high wooden chairs, opting instead for a more comfortable circular table. There are a variety of beverages on offer, but surprisingly, only one Russian beer – Baltica - which is a something of a shame as beer goes so well with dumplings and it would be nice to see this business supporting the growing Russian craft beer and ale scene.',\n",
       " \"We stayed not far from the restaurant, and found the great reviews of this place. We decided to try it ourself, and hey, it is a good place to try various kind of dumplings. We tried the Manti, Khinkali, Verenyky and their version of japanese Gyoza. My personal favorite was Khinkali, the Georgian dumplings, filled with meat and a bit of broth, just like the chinese's xiao long bao. The dumplings are quite big for Asian standard, so it is enough for both of us to order 3-5 pieces each menu.\",\n",
       " \"What an interesting concept. Dumplings from all over. We were at the end of a dreary day (weatherwise) and looking for warm full tummies. This menu did the trick. And for a good price.

       " 'Very efficient restaurant.  Self seating, with quick attentive service.  The menu is pelmeni, pelmeni, pelmeni, but variations on that cuisine. I prefer the traditional meat pelmeni, but other fillings are also available. Two types of \"ook soose\" available!

It offers different kinds of dishes as italian raviolli.\\nAs Russian, I could advice you to taste boiled beef \"pemeni\" with cream.\\nI eat japanese gedza but it was not the best. Vegetables were ok, but sauerkraut was not fresh, had a little smell. \\nAnyway everything was ok, nice stuff and service.',\n",

This place was great.  Prepared just like they should be, nice casual atmosphere, friendly service, great value for money.  We stopped for a late lunch before visiting the Faberge museum.

My Russian parents and American husband loved Pelmenya. We ate there 4-5 times and tried pretty much everything on the menu. Xinkali were my favorite. Manti and pelmeni were very good as well.

Pelmeni are Russian dumplings but we also sampled dumplings from Uzbekistan, Georgia, Ukraine and Japan. if you're not sure, have a small plate of 3 and then order more if you like them. There is a menu in English and the waitress was very helpful and explained what each different type was. Service is great and the prices are very reasonable. It's also very handy if you are planning on taking a boat trip to see the bridges.\",\n",

If you are uncertain you only need order 3 to 5 dumplings and reorder those you like best so great if you are with your family or in a small group. Dumplings are served quickly and are all very tasty so it is quick, fun and convenient to try them all out. Good choice for vegetarians or fussy eaters or those more sophisticated who can have prawn and water chestnut dumplings! Menu in English available and staff willing, friendly and quite good at English too. We visited in April and no reservation necessary. Ideal if you want to independently visit the Faberge Museum which you can only do after 6pm and then have a nice family friendly dinner before returning to your hotel',\n",

That happens everywhere sometimes, but the unusual part is the waitress came out and admitted the mistake.  In Russia that is not very common.  My Russian is very poor so that sort of situation can be tricky but they were really nice about it and offered to remake it.  Because it takes 20 minutes and I was already pretty full I declined, and they removed the item from our bill even though we ate some of it.',\n",

Remember to eat them correctly - using hands - first you bite a small bite of the \"shell\" and drink insides, then eat the rest - ask waitresses they explain :) Also we tried \"manty\" - dumplings made on steam; with lamb - tasty! fabulous! They were accompanied by sour cream and fresh vegetables. Excellent Belgium beer as a drink choice - honest Belgium quality!',\n",

We both had the crab & avocado salad which was beautifully presented with more beetroot dip & other sauce. Maggie had the beef tagine, an enormous amount of shredded beef which was rather dry without gravy/ sauce but nonetheless tasty. I had the king prawns with saffron sauce, accompanied by a timbale of rice & veg, & avocado & chopped tomato. Then as we sat back, replete, the host brought a complimentary pot of verbena tea & a caraway biscuit each. All delicious & good value for money. Highly recommended.',\n",

The avocado was deliciously creamy, and its flavor was complemented excellently by fresh tomatoes and red onion. The crab meat inside was beautiful. We learned from the staff that the chef at The Loft is the original creator of this dish, which we had seen on several restaurants in Essaouira. While the rest of the menu changes all the time, this staple stays by popular demand. We understood why! Afterwards we split a seafood tagliatelle in spicy tomato sauce and a salmon dish. Both were excellent! Could not recommend this place more! It was a huge highlight of the trip!',\n",

       " 'From the start this meal was bad- especially given the price. We visited for my husbands birthday after being recommended by our local hotel. The lady in charge appeared at our table as we arrived to basically up-sell the truffle menu. Plonked some truffles on the table and then with no explanation of how they would enhance the dishes gave us a rehearsed speech which she proceeded to repeat word for word at every single table. If the food had been good we could have forgiven this but it wasn’t. The best parts were the bland bits as at least they were inoffensive - nothing was seasoned and sauces were completely tasteless with strange and weird combinations. But the worst part of the meal was my husbands inedible medallions of ‘lamb’ dish. This was made up of a tiny amount of lamb gristle and fat wrapped around some mushy stuff we couldn’t identify. Fillet of beef was sort of well cooked (frankly hard to get wrong) but served with exactly the same sauce as the lamb, some reconstituted mash in strange tube shapes and tasteless, watery spinach. We asked for wine recommendations. The wines were ok but we weren’t told what they were, they weren’t explained to us (I had to ask what mine was and was told it was ‘local’) and we weren’t offered any to try. With so much choice nearby and so many better (and much cheaper options) I’d avoid.',\n",

Halfway through our meal (truffle tasting menu with wine pairing), we asked to move anywhere else because it was too warm there.\\nThe young waitress (the daughter) asked the manager (her mum) to move us, but she replies a very sharp NO!!!!! Also, a dog pooped just in front of us, on the pedestrian side, but apparently, according to the same waitress, that was nothing that concerned the restaurant. Anyhow now not only was it crazy hot but with a nice poo view too.\\nSo we could not move anywhere even though the restaurant was empty, for no reason. Asked to talk to her mum (The Manager) she never touches the table or acknowledges us. How can you deny to a couple with 230 euro bills to move to another table when your restaurant is empty? \\nFinally, a gem of a waitress with curly hair approached the table and moved us to another spot, where we spent the rest of the evening in confinement because as I said one side of the restaurant was empty for the whole night.\\nI have been managing restaurants for my whole life, and I never gave such an awful service and attitude to my guests.\\n\\nThe tempo of service completely wrong, food was getting to our table way earlier than wine.\\nThe wine was poured into the glasses and set in the station for about 20 minutes before being served, subjected to the bacterias and dust since everyone was passing by.\\n\\nFood was good but if you are used to first-class and fine dining service keep out from this place!\",\n",

We dined at other restaurants in Rome the same week that served far more flavorful truffles at a much lower price, so recognize the difference!  The service was slow and disjointed.

She argued with us saying\"well, that is how we make it.\" About another 30 minutes passed and our second course arrive, again stone cold-it was a pasta dish that was way under cooked, not just al dente. We did not eat more than a few bites but sat there for about 20 minutes until someone came by to clear the plates-we told her that the food was not edible and asked for our waitress--after sitting for about 10-15 more minutes we decided to get up an leave-the waitress never appeared until we started to walk out and then she said our main course was ready.

When I wrote to the restaurant afterwards to complain about the situation, I got a very dismissive letter back from the owner, essentially stating: \"other people love this table; I guess you didn\\'t.\" No apology was offered.

We eventually got our amuse bouche at around 22:00 at least an hour after we arrived. \\n\\nWe ordered the truffle set menu. The food ranged between being average and quite good, never really good. At odds with other reviews a few words of warning. The truffle menu is a poor choice. Truffle is delicious but a whole meal with the same flavour doesn't work. Second unless you are very hungry avoid the menus. The volume of food is enormous. We left quite a lot of the anti pasti and especially the pasta course. \\n\\nWe eventually left around midnight.

It took another 30 minutes for our first glass of wine and burrata appetizer to arrive at the table. \\n\\nThe burrata with the upgrade of white truffle. This dish was around $50, and when it arrived a small fly landed on it... No big deal it happens. When the waitress and I tried to get it off it was killed on the cheese.

I\\'m not sure that the 2nd burrata was new and that they threw away the original dish, given how expensive white truffles are, but it should have been. \\n\\nThe 3 way carbonara came out practically cold too. No one ever came to see if we wanted another drink until the end of our meal. When we ordered wine glasses were just brought over a glass, no wine was ever presented to the table as with other restaurants in this price range. Some staff apologized at one point saying the service issues were because they were busy, I\\'m not sure how that was my problem. They hold themselves out as a fine dining experience and at least mine was far, far from that. I would tell you to ignore the inflated reviews and look for something better.',\n",

Except that there are two wines per page, and they aren’t listed by country of origin, or varietal type – they’re listed by what someone (God knows who) thinks is the type.  Who would have guessed a Chianti Classico is a “full bodied red”?  Certainly no one who knows wine.  In any normal restaurant this wine list would run maybe 6 or 7 pages at the most.  Apparently wines by the glass are a state secret, you have to ask if they have them.   \\n\\nRubbery, overcooked octopus, brittle fried pumpkin flowers, devoid of taste, topped with cold ricotta, a filet that could only be described as a low-end USDA Choice from a chain steakhouse in the US, also rubbery and tasteless.  At least the fish was cooked properly, but was lying on a hockey puck of warm wilted spinach.\\n\\nAppallingly bad service, one hour to get the appetizer.

The free glass of wine, the free pre desert and the free bottle of house olive oil was appreciated and the staff were excellent in every way especially the bald waiter with the blue eyes who was amazing at his job but the food was total crap!\\n\\nWe each got the black truffle tasting menu, it was our last night so we decided to splash out a bit and the table behind us (an American family) also got the black truffle tasting menu. The starters were ok. 2 of them were the same but one had basil and the beef tartar was bland.\\n\\nThe truffle carbonara was very nice, but the spaghetti dish was average. The ox cheek was tough with a sirloin type fat down one side. At this time the table behind us got a steak and we noticed them complaining that it was tough so it wasn\\'t just us. For this reason I believe the meat to be poorly sourced. The duck however was decent.\\n\\nThe deserts were all crap, we actually didn\\'t finish them. Meanwhile the Americans on the table behind us were blown away by the same dishes we disliked which leads me to believe that the reviews of this place are mostly by Americans \"visiting Europe\". \\n\\nI never know which reviews to trust so if you\\'re reading this take the opinion of someone who has eaten at Michelin star restaurants around the world and has a knack for finding hidden gems, this place, in a nut shell, the food is below average with truffle on top.

       " \"I don't write negative reviews. I'd rather say nothing because everybody can have an off night and I've worked in food and know how tough it can be. But one thing out of several missteps prompted me to write this. I hope I save someone who really wants to experience good Roman food from disappointment (and it's not hard to find good food in Rome!).  First, this is tourist food; upscale to be sure. The focus on truffles is not really representative of Roman cuisine (if that's what you what).  You can get that type of menu in many upscale hotels in many places. I could tolerate that--it is what it is-- had our food been served appropriately.I went for the Roman menu hoping for tradition and creativity to meet well. My partner went for the land menu. Both suffered the same problem.  Some of this food was cooked way ahead. That can be done with some things but not others. Dishes that should have been hot were served cold. I'm talking cold gummy pasta carbonara, people! Another dish--intended to be hot- was warm in one part and not just cold but ice cold in another. That is just not excusable. Service this evening was also chaotic, but I felt bad for the 3 young women who were dealing with some 8-10 top  tourist groups and only one of them seemed to be a professional server. I've been coming to Rome for 30 years and I have NEVER experienced anything like this. We decided to pay and leave after the pasta debacle (I actually sent it back and waited 45 minutes for the server to return with a replacement--never happened), even though we weren't halfway through the fixed menu. The poor server was very apologetic and refused to let us pay. I'm hoping this was a problematic evening and won't occur again, although I'm pretty sure much of the food is made too far ahead (fried foods much be served subito-- the fritti were lukewarm going on cold) or the food isn't getting from kitchen to table promptly. I should have known better, but I trusted reviews and even recommendations from travel advisors I know. If you are planning for this to be your splurge in Rome, you might think twice about it. My advice: go simple in Rome; it's almost always good if not great.\",\n",
       " \"After several recommendations, and a quick read through on TA feedbacks - we booked Ad Hoc for our last night in Rome. We are both global travelers, and we know a good restaurant from a great. This ended up as neither of the two.\\nWe arrived with expectations, and our expectations were raised even further after being escorted to our table. The interior is inviting - with romantic seating and wine bottles covering the wall from floor to ceiling. Prosecco as a complimentary aperitif is never wrong either.\\nWe received the menu, and decided to go with the truffle tasting menu - despite being slightly off season. We went with full wine pairing, and from here and out our expectations were thrown off a cliff...\\nThe one thing that surprised us the most, was the constant waiting(which we could easily notice being a distraction for the tables next to us as well) There was an extreme amount of dead time between the courses, and this is where we found the wine pairing to be a mistake. The wines offered as part of the wine package were well balanced with the courses served, but in small servings. With 30 minutes to the next course, and with no offers for a refill or other supplementary drinks. Weird!\\nFood? Started off well with a variety of starters. Cheese, deep fried veggies and truffles as front runners - the starter was heavy...but rather pleasant. Last one on the plate was a beef tartare. Unseasoned, as they felt we should season by taste ourselves... What???\\nPasta course was a duo of pastas. Both creamy and cheesy and heavy - loaded with truffle shavings. I'd loved it if this was the only heavy course, but already by now - the meal is loosing balance. There are no vegetables, and no acidity to balance the weight of cream/cheese/truffles.\\nMain course. Duck breast and beef cheek loaded with truffles. Duck breast - cold and rubbery. Beef cheek - cold and tasteless(salty if anything at all) We sent it back, and started to loose patience.\\nDecided to wait for desserts. All good, but guess what - all creamy and heavy! A fresh sorbet could have saved half the day, but was unfortunately not part of the game.\\nAll in all - I can only recommend the wines served(although served in a strange way...bottles were never brought to the table?)\\nWe had the main courses removed from our bill - which helped on our mood...although I took that more or less for granted.\\nSorry to say - this experience is no where near our top 10 in Rome...\",\n",

A pork dish ok but not hot. Passed on desserts. We then waited for 20 minutes for a check. The owner was very kind and gave us olive oil and a bottle of wine gratis. Also you would expect people to be dressed properly, shorts on a Sunday night come on. This is not a fine dinning restaurant.',\n",
       " 'We were excited given the good reviews for this restaurant but the food was an attempt to produce something creative and special but they failed miserably.  The food has no taste.  Tried both the land and sea tasting menus.  Really frustrating when the service is soooo slow to have to wait for long between courses and have one flop after the other being served.  The staff act like they are serving exquisite dishes and take too much time explaining and make you wait forever which makes the whole experience even more worse.  The locale has character since you are sitting in the middle of a wine cellar but once you start the experience you realize that it is not authentic at all.   When we expressed concern over the slow service they became defensive and then offensive.  showing no respect and condescendence to customers.   Do not recommend at all.',\n",
       " 'We (my wife, my son and I) had a terrible experience in ad-hoc on Thursday 5 January 2017. It is a miracle that this restaurant is in the Roma top 100 with such poor food, atmosphere, attitude, service, organisation, heating, etc...Only the wine was good. We had far far far better experiences during our stay in Roma, including at Babette, which is in the same area.\\nWe booked by phone the day before for three and arrived on time at 800pm. We were seated in the room on the right side when you enter the restaurant and we felt immediatly uncomfortable with the temperature of the room despite a very visible (and working) heating system. There were permanent flows of cold and hot airs in the room. We complained to the head waitress (the boss?) who said they have a problem with the door (in fact, even when the door was completly closed, the issue with the temperature was more or less the same) and said she will do her best to move us to another table. This did not happen despite a table that we could see became available at some stage and stayed free for may be 30 minutes. At the end of the dinner (during which my wife kept her coat...) we asked why she did not move us to the other table and she said (believe it or not): \"because it is a table for four and you are only three\"....translation: i do not care about your health but i care about making money even if i have to over-promise for this.\\nGenerally speaking we found that the head waitress (the boss?) overpromised on everything during this dinner...and under-delivered.\\nRegarding food, the truffle experience was expensive and disappointing. We would rate the food somewhere between \"nothing special\" for the pasta and \"bad\" for the duck which was served dry when we asked medium rare. We noticed that people at the table next to us complained about the beef.\\nThe Tuscany red wine was good...but do you need to introduce it with tons of words and superlatives as you would do for a Chateau Petrus 1982?\\nThe service was very very long...it took one hour to get the first course and then another hour to get the second one and nothing seemed really properly organised and managed.\\nWhen we decided to stop the experience before the dessert and asked for the bill, the head waitress (the boss?) asked about our feeling. We told us exactly what was our view: big problem with the temperature, no transfer to the other table when it was available, nothing special (at best) with the food and good wine. She said several times she was confused but did not seem to be so confused...More a bad actress than a good head waitress (or a boss?).\\nThe bill included a 10% discount which seems to be applicable when you make an internet booking...but we realized after we left the restaurant that our first courses were charged at €30 vs €25. Based on other reviews, we believe it is because the black trufle was partly replaced by white trufle. This was our choice but when this option was proposed by the waitress she never mentioned we have to pay an extra for this.\\nFinally, when we asked for our coats, a waitress gave us a probably very expensive Moncler down jacket...which was not belonging to us. Imagine what could have happened with clients less honest than we are...Don\\'t go there with expensive coats!\\nNever again! and FYI we are used to go to all sort of restaurants privately or because of our jobs, from small local restaurants to 3* Michelin restaurants (see our other reviews) and we believe we are able to make the difference between good and bad food, good and bad service, etc...',\n",

It started with being presented with a small table spoon of cold mash potato, compliments of the chef they said...um ok wasn't particularly tasty I left half of mine. \\nthen came the tasting plate, this was perhaps the nicest of all the dishes, a plate segmented into 3 with a cold battered pumpkin flower, a burrata, and the poorest excuse of steak tartar I have ever seen. simply a square of raw mince and 3 slices of truffle, no capers, nothing else. \\nthe pasta was presented , two of them , however they tasted exactly the same...i liked them but wondered why you would put two of essentially the same pasta of the same plate... this was also an issue as the pasta was on this silly little plate and whilst eating one side the other got cold so again that wasn't very nice.\\nNext the mains...2 tiny slices of dry over cooked duck breast with sliced truffle, on what appeared to be the same cold potato we got at the start, and a beef cheek thing, which was nice, but some what confused in the whole tasting menu...\\n\\nYou did however get a very good amount of truffles...this I can't fault them of... I however would recommend that people don't do the tasting menu, rather order from the main menu and perhaps order an item or 2 with truffles..\\n\\nFinally we had what will perhaps be the worst Tiramisu I have every ordered, it tasted like it was one layer of biscuit and then they got some of the whipped cream in a can and sprayed on top....not nice, maybe at the Cheese cake factory but not at a decent restaurant.\\n\\nNow the final and somewhat laughable moment, some of our group wanted to buy fresh truffles, they went to the back and were presented with fresh black truffles ....how much we ask ...600 euro a kilo....umm no\\nNext morning we go to Campo Di Fiori ask the vendor who talks to a guy, price 180 euro a kilo.....\\n\\nSo in short no I wouldn't recommend dining here, glad we caught up with our friends, just wish it was a better meal.

We were invited to the pre-meal truffle tasting which was a nice touch and this started our evening off well with a free glass of prosecco to go with it. First impressions were good at the restaurant with another free glass of prosecco as we perused the menu. The wine list was extensive but there were choices for all palates and budgets, and we were very happy with our choice. Unfortunately that's where our positive experiences ended. We were left feeling very underwhelmed with the food when it arrived - whilst it looked good visually it simply lacked in taste. My pasta dish was nice but steak for main was cold on arrival. My girlfriend chose a truffle pasta that was far from impressive (and it should have been for the price!) and she couldn't eat the suckling pork chosen for mains - it came with no accompaniments meaning you had simply 2 big bits of meat on a plate). The staff offered to get an alternative as we didn't like the pork, but we had lost faith and decided against it. For the same reason we chose not to get dessert. The restaurant knocked off half the cost of the pork main from our bill, which was appreciated, but honestly we'd rather have paid full price and enjoyed our meal. After having high hopes it feels like the restaurant is a little style over substance. With sadness, this was a very disappointing end to our trip.

The consensus: no interesting flavors in anything we tried, salt being the dominant (and only clearly discernible) one. We did not complain, but it felt like the staff knew the kitchen was underperforming; everyone around was plied with multiple freebies. We received complimentary sparkling wine with a pre-appetizer, a pre-desert and a post-desert, an extra desert wine and a take home bag of goodies. The restaurant is very cute, has a nice vibe, and an interesting sounding menu that offers creative alternatives to traditional Roman food. It has an impressive wine collection and accommodating staff. It could have been a wonderful place—if it served good food. \\n\\nThe cranky naysayers are prone to utter things like: \"It was the worst meal we had in ... \" Unfortunately, even this unkind sentence applies to our experience as well. During our 5-day Roman holiday, it was the worst meal we had. That is even taking into account that some of our meals were totally un-fancy, like a salmon sandwich served on a paper plate. But it was a pretty damn tasty sandwich. Since it is impossible to build a great reputation by serving mediocre food, I conclude that Ad Hoc had better days. In view of that, I don\\'t know how to interpret our experience. Exploiting old, but now badly faded glory? Having a really bad day? The chef quit in the morning? Well, I won\\'t find out, since a return visit is rather unlikely.',\n",

To begin, the menus were missing a number of items one of which was a seared duck salad that was substituted with a cheese salad. Not a suitable replacement. Additionally there was only one type of truffle available which meant we didnt opt for this tasting menu. All of the food itself was bland and lacked seasoning with the exception of the pasta course and a number of dishes were cooked terribly. The beef cheek for example was like chewing leather despite being such a tender cut of meat. The service was also awful, with one of the waitresses contstantly slamming down our dishes and having a serious attitude problem. The only saving grace about this place is that the wines are fantastic and are very reasonably priced alongside the tasting menu. I would not return however for this alone and would head on down to Trastevere where the food is exceptional and a fraction of the price.',\n",

However the food was really unimpressive especially considering the cost, 130 euros for antipasti, first and second courses and a bottle of wine, we didn't want to take the chance with dessert. The antipasti were the best part of the meal and everything else suffered from pretty big cooking errors that you wouldn't expect at an establishment of this calibre,  such as splitting the eggs for the carbonara so it was basically pasta stuck together solidly by scrambled eggs. Complimentary truffle tasting and bottle of sparkling wine were nice.

The first course was rather ok and so was the pasta. The main course was not ok - it did not taste anything. I had also asked in advance if they could have a surprice for my mother - but the only thing she got was a candle on her dessert (which we had ordered already). The waiter continued to be rude out through the evening!! I would not recommend this restaurant!',\n",
       " \"I recently arrived about five minutes early for a 9:30pm dinner reservation on a Saturday evening.  I had planned on doing the tasting menu as it was the last evening of my holiday.  The reviews on Trip Advisor were relatively positive, so this helped to drive my dining decision for that evening.\\n\\nUpon arrival at the restaurant, there was no host or hostess at the door to greet customers.  I understand that service is quite lacking in Italy and not up to American standards, but a simple greeting is not much to expect.  I observed two rather haggard looking servers who were running around like chickens with their heads cut off as the restaurant was pretty full.\\n\\nMy guest and I were finally greeted by one of the servers who was a bit snarly.  She sat us at our table, which faced both the front door and the service station, so it really wasn't the best seat in the house.  I was disappointed, but there really was not anything that we could do about it.\\n\\nWe were presented with menus after about a 5 minute wait and then our server disappeared to assist with other tables.  After about 15 minutes, she came over and took our order, including our wine order.  But then disappeared.  Each time that we tried to flag her down, she just rolled her eyes at us and ran to assist the other server or other tables.\\n\\nAfter another 10 minutes, she came back and informed us that the wine that we had ordered was no longer available.  I then proceeded to select another wine.  She then returned to the table 10 minutes later with the new bottle.  The appalling part is that she simply slammed the bottle down on the table and then ran off to assist another table without opening our wine.  I'm really not sure why, but her behavior was unprofessional and downright insulting.  \\n\\nSo now after 40 minutes of sitting at the table, we still had no wine or food.  This was probably some of the sloppiest and rudest service that I have ever experienced. This is not the way that we envisioned our last meal in Rome.  My guest and I ultimately decided to leave and find a restaurant that appreciated our business.  As such, we simply got up and left.  The funny part is that neither server even noticed that we were leaving or had left as they were too busy with other tables. \\n\\nHopefully, if you're seeking out a fine dining experience, which should include superior service in addition to good food, I would suggest looking elsewhere.\\n\\nYou've been duly warned!\",\n",
       " \"We specifically went to this place after reading all the wonderful reviews here. It started out wonderfully with a truffle tasting in a private room with sparking wine. Unfortunately, what started out as an experience ended with us cutting off the meal early. \\n\\nWe are a party of four and were the third table seated at our 6:30 reservation. We ordered a bottle of wine and appetizers. We had the pumpkin blossoms, the seafood sampler, and the cheese tasting. Everything was mediocre at best, but presented very nicely. Once the appetizer was cleared we finished our bottle of wine and had to wait 45 minutes before our pasta was brought to the table. Again this was mediocre at best, but displayed very nicely. \\n\\nThe wait staff never came by to fill up water or ask we if wanted another bottle of wine. Finally they cleared the pasta and we set in to wait for our second course. A rabbit stuffed with spiced veal. Needless to say we never made it that far. At 9pm we had to get up and track the manager down, whom never once came over to check on us, and tell her we were done. \\n\\nThe consolation was sending the head waitress over to offer a sparkling wine. For all the hype and the price you're paying, this was absolutely unacceptable and unenjoyable. We were very disappointed after all the high reviews here on trip advisor. \\n\\nBeware as the entire audience was foreigners and there was never a wait. A restaurant rated this highly should be reservation only.\",\n",
       " \"Probably the most disappointed I've been in a restaurant strongly recommended by trip advisor! My two selections for a main course - rabbit and fish of the day were adequate - however portions were minimalist and rabbit was ground!My daughter's filet strips were, I believe, also ground and past due date! I know about aged beef, as my father raised angus, this had been hung WAY too long! Asked that my daughter's be taken back, which was done, but found it added to bill! Thankfully, upon my objection they removed it! I would never return to this restaurant and felt that I was mislead by trip advisor whom I continually proclaim to be priceline's arch rival! Maybe not so! I hope to not be disappointed again, as I may have to drop my allegiance to TA, as well as, my stock!\",\n",
       " \"My boyfriend and I visited the Ad Hoc restaurant on the second of our two night stay in Rome. We had read fantastic reviews and were really keen to go, we actually tired to book on our first evening to no avail, as it was fully booked. Having secured a table for our last night we were looking forward to a fantastic meal. We arrived and were greeted by a friendly-ish blonde lady (in a rather short skirt!) and were shown to our table. We were seated for at least 5 minutes, if not more, before anyone came over to offer us a menu/drink etc but were willing to overlook this because of the fantastic reputation. We finally had sight of a menu, not before being told that the prawns and cod were unavailable for the evening. We placed our order and thought all was well, until the waitress came over to confirm what my boyfriend had ordered because in her words she was 'confused': not something you expect when paying the prices they ask for. We were then served an apperetife by a different waitress and shown the wine list (finally!). The apperetife was lovely and we decided to order a bottle of Riesling wine to go with out food - not before having been told that they 'might not have it', due to a busy night the night before. Again, not what you would expect when paying through the nose for a gastronomic experience. After a long wait, our main courses finally arrived, although, sadly, all I could taste was an unhealthy level of salt over the main dish and the sides. We mentioned to the waitress after finishing our main courses that this was the case and she acknowledged this (having not checked our food and asked if we were ok the whole way through the meal). We were then left at our table for a fairly solid amount of time, during which we witnessed what was frankly a shocking display between two members of staff (curiously, both the staff members who had served us) engaging in a full blown argument which included raising voices in front of guests, slamming plates and menus and even resulted in the manager becoming involved. As an aside - the table next to us had ordered the taster menu and when their food arrived the waitress (the same one serving us) had to question the food she was serving them as she couldn't remember what it was and then proceeded to swap the plates round twice because she could not remember who had ordered what. We were then asked whether we would like a desert, to which we replied no and asked for the bill. We were then asked to come over to the window tables because the card machine would not work where we were sitting. Upon delivery of our bill, we were also issued with a feedback form, on which we commented that the food had been average and certainly not what you would expect for the price and the service had been terrible. The only saving grace of the evening was the bottle of sparkling wine which every female guest was given upon departure. We are a young couple in our mid twenties and are lucky enough to have eaten in some of the worlds best restaurants, we are not overly fussy but the service we received at Ad Hoc was absolutely disgraceful in terms of the way the staff were behaving in front of paying customers and we would absolutely not recommend this restaurant to anyone, we were offered no discount and the meal cost us €130. I urge you to think twice before you consider going for a meal here, not cheap and disappointingly average food but we could have overlooked this had the service been exceptional, which it certainly was not.\",\n",
       " \"I went to this place to celebrate my birthday and had a big disappointment. I ordered the truffled gnocchi that cost 25 euros and the waitress said:_black or white truffle? So I said white, I don't even know why. The food was OK and when the bill came they charged me 45 euros for my plate!!! So when I complained they told me in front of everyone that I should know the white truffle is much more expensive that the others, even though the price wasn't anywhere. You can imagine the humiliation. I think any restaurant should know you don't offer something that will double the price of the dish without warning the costumer, only if you have bad intentions of over-charging it. Thank God for trip advisor and the power we have of telling our story so the same won't happen to other travellers.\",\n",
       " 'It is a mystery to us where all these excellent reviews come from, because this is for sure not one of the best restaurants in rome. It is definitely nothing special, with things on their card that are not in season, and fish i.e. tuna being served that is past its date. We would for sure not go back and not really recommend this restaurant either. Also the service was not great, the waitresses were friendly but slow.',\n",

       " \"Let me start by saying that I don't eat to live but live to eat! I chose this restaurant based on the raving reviews.  Well what a dissapointment. It was not a disaster but is was below average. The restaurant does have a very nice decor and ambience, nice jazzy lounge music (the same cd played in loop all evening, hearing the songs 3 times). The young attractive hostesses were nice but do not know anything about food or wine.\\n We chose the Sea tasting menu with wine pairing. Instead of pouring the wine at the table, they bring you your glass and tell you what it is. The first wine, supposedly a Chardonay was terrible so I asked to see the bottle. They brought me a bottle that was not open and told me that was the wine. I asked if they could bring us the bottles from there on, they did not. I asked to swith the Rose wine with a Red to go with the pasta, which they did, but it was just the wrong type of red for this, maybe my faut. A couple of the dish we had were good, lobster pasta and the baby squid. The rest was ok or below average. I had asked to switch the creme brule deserts with the other two, which agreed and aknowledged but they brought us the creme brules anyway. \\n Everything about this restaurant is like presuming to be something they are not, everything is superficial. No reputable restaurant gives 10% off for booking online and thta alone should have been my flag. I have a hard time understanding how people can write that this is the best restaurant they have eaten in in their life. We spent 12 days in Italy ad this was by far our worst experience in Rome,I was more angry at wasting my time than the money!  Try Il Gabriello, that wowed us, try the seefood ravioli and the seafood pasta.\",\n",
       " 'We were looking forward to this restaurant, but it turned out to be a total disaster. We had to wait at least 40 minutes between each course, and the food was terrible. Only the buffalo cheese in the starter was Ok, everything else from our tasting menu was horrible. Both the taste and texture was the worst I have ever experienced in a restaurant. Service was Ok, but very slow, we had to wait for 10 minutes for water, and 20 minutes for the bill, they seem to ignore the first time you asked, and only acts on the second time. We find everyone dined there speaks English, which is not a good sign for a restaurant in Rome. Two tasting menu plus wines and a stater cost 155 euro, spend your money elsewhere and you can get much better food for 50 euro for 2 people.',\n",

Either that or they just couldn't be bothered to explain anything to us. We placed our order and were not served our starter for 45 mins. It then took ANOTHER HOUR (I kid you not) to be served our mains. \\n\\nI ordered the smoked salmon pasta which was hard and actually inedible. I picked out the salmon and just sent it back without asking for a replacement, or refund before you ask. The whole dish was just a disaster. Quite frankly, my 7 year old can cook a better pasta dish than that which was served to me that evening. The pasta course alone was £15. \\n\\nThe started, I can't remember what it was meant to be but it was heavy and greasy- possibly courgette flowers, I don't recall. \\n\\nI ordered the 2-spilt mains and chose the catch of the day and tuna. They were both terrible. Really, I might as well have been in Bella Italia in Croydon for the quality of the food. \\n\\nBy the time we finished our first three courses it was nearly 11.30pm. By this point we were so tired and irritated by the poor service and poor food that we decided not to stay for dessert. Possibly the best decision I made during my weekend in Rome. \\n\\n£115 for 3 courses, not inc dessert or wine. \\n\\nLess bothered am I about the £115 that I won't get back as the 2 and a half hours of my life spent dining there that could have been spent enjoying a meal elsewhere.\",\n",

       " 'We chose this restaurant because Trip Advisor ranked it among the top (#8 of 5922) restaurants in Rome, Italy. \\n\\nOn our first attempt, we were told that because we had no reservations we could not dine there that night. The following day we made the reservation and we got a table for two. The restaurant was not busy that night. The space was ample where we were seated so I re-arranged my seat in order that I will be seated next to my wife and not across from her as we had always done in other restaurants. One of the hostesses approached us and told me that I should not move my chair from the original arrangement and did not elaborate further. I was quite surprised because we had never experienced this policy and besides they did not offer to seat us together in another table, as there were many empty tables that night. Because of this event, we were made to feel as “unwanted” patrons.\\n\\nIt took another 20-30 minutes before we were asked about our orders. We also had to request for a wine list as we were not provided a list with the menu. When we asked we were told by the server, “Oh, you want a glass of wine?” “What kind? We again asked that we please be provided with the wine list.\\n\\nWe ordered: a bottle of red wine; “ad hoc” pumpkin flowers for starters; flat spaghetti with baby squid for our pasta; and sea bass fillet, for our main course. Except for the “ad hoc”pumpkin flowers, which were quite good, the rest of the food were not out of the ordinary and quite saltier than what we would have preferred. Furthermore, throughout our dinner, we had to repeatedly request for attendance to our dining needs including extra  utensils, water, and even pepper.\\n\\nThe ambiance of this place was replete with the plasticity of protocol demonstrated by the entire staff which detracted from the “Italian warm hospitality” we expected. We felt that we and others just trying to have a good culinary experience should not be treated this way. At the “Ad Hoc, we had an “Ad Nauseam”Experience.',\n",
       " \"I have to say that I had great expectations from this restaurant. I am always disappointed from the offer of estaurant in Rome: tradiational ones are boring, most expensive one often disappointing (a part from Il Pagliaccio, but it is ineed expensive). The worst restaurant in the world is in Rome (Convivio Troiani...). So, an acceptably priced, good level restaurant is sorely missed. Well, Ad hoc did not fill the gap. I had the gastronomy menu, to try their best effort. With wines... Lets start with the good things: some starters were good (courgette flowers, tartare's...) and the wines offered with the menu are really good. Than, the sore point: salt and some average cooking in the pasta and main dishes. Come on, the spaghetti in the parmigiano nest are trivial from one side, and a concentrate of salt from the other. A lot of the dishes were far too salty. The mains were not exciting, nothing really to lift them from a honest average. Not what I was looking for. Just a bad night? No sure.....\",\n",

We showed up  late for our already late reservation, and I think that the staff was not thrilled that we had shown up in the first place. But the situation quickly devolved from there.\\n\\nMy biggest negative  about the place may have been the mistranslations of the menu.  We were given English menus with Italian, which I can\\'t argue against, but the translations were so bad that what we ordered and what we received were more than a little different.  For example, my older son ordered a beef filet.  What arrived was ground veal cheek with raisins and pine nuts. Which is what the Italian menu says it is.  They were nice about it and refunded our money,  but, for a place that clearly was full of British tourists, it seemed to be a major mistake.  An English menu item for suckling pig ended up being a rolled sausage of some form.  Since many of the reviewers had either a tasting menu or truffle pasta they may not have noted this but if you go ala carte its important. \\n\\nMy wife had ordered the truffle pasta.  This was fine, but she originally received another pasta.  They did correct this error.  \\n\\nRegardless of the menu descriptions, many of the dishes suffered from the \"one ingredient too many syndrome.\"  \\n\\nOther negatives may have been more temporary.  The restaurant was stuffy and hot.  Although our server was nice, the woman who appeared to be functioning as the head server was not.  I don\\'t think she saw me watching her as she made a \"tongue out of the mouth\" face while gesturing with her eyes at our table.  Nice.\\n\\nI do know that we our outliers in terms of what we think about this place and I do know that we were not completely innocent guests as we were 25\\' late for our table.

Secondly there were no locals eating there - another warning sign.\\n\\nThen they brought the grissini which were soft when I bit into them, and the bread was stale. After the first course which was dismal we cancelled the rest of the courses and left. It was nice of them to take the food items we had half-eaten off the bill and only charge for the over-priced wine we had ordered. As for the atmosphere it is very dark inside and has a very touristy feel to it. \\n\\nTo conclude, judging from the prices in comFranceon to other establishments, this place is a tourist trap, as it is on Via Ripetta which is off Via del Corso the main street in Rome which is crowded with tourists.',\n",

I also overheard the guy at the next table who ordered the same tasting menu Say the same thing to the server as he returned his plate. The desert was fine.\\nOverall, not exceptional and not recommended. I'd say average, but for the price (80 euro per person) I expected more.\",\n",
       " 'Upon entering, thought we scored with a great atmosphere and pleasant staff. Had a fabulous beef carpaccio appetizer and a skeevishly warm seafood tartar appetizer. Our beef truffle entre was cold, dry, and clearly reheated. The suckling pig was more like pork jerky. The stuffed rabbit was not what was expected and had two large pieces of solid fat in it. It was much like a rabbit meat loaf. The wine list was great but we do not recommend wasting your money and time at Ad Hoc',\n",
       " \"Go Ad Hoc if you don't mind articifical service and tourist style truffles menu.\\n\\nI did lot of research before all trips for food and TripAdvisor is one good source.  I seldom picked the top 10 restaurants as it was rated high mostly because of the no of visits are highest, and the restaurant is likely a commercialized tourist place.   This time I made a big mistake to choose Ad Hoc because it is just 3 min walk from our Boutique hotel and convenient for dinner.\\n\\nIt was a total waste of time and money.   Food quality was much below average especially if you consider the price.   Bread was cold and nothing special.   All truffle dishes tasted alike, salty and could not match well with the pasta or meat.  Carbonara was disaster.  My lady girlfriend just touched a bit and left all in the plate.\\n\\nService was artificial and slow.  The only good thing was they speak good English while most local Italian restaurant not.   The waiter was cruel in the beginning and started to smile after her manager turned up to greet us.   But you could tell that it was tourist place kind of service.\\n\\nWe visited a small restaurant just around the corner the other day which was much better.   At least the ingredient was fresh and the smile was genuine.\",\n",
       " \"Restaurant - for tourists! That has read on a site, and has seen, these are two different things. Experiment was awful. In salad begun to ruccola which was in a bottom that it haven't noticed, bound together macaroni and unfairly expensive wines. The account comprised any percent and not clear dish. In my opinion it has been obviously overestimated! Italian at this restaurant isn't present anything, as it seemed to me. I think, Italians aren't frequenters of this institution!!!! When I was, saw only tourists and heard only English-speaking speech. I believe in Rome there are enough wonderful places which can be visited, instead of this institution!!!!!\",\n",
       " \"I feel ridiculous that we let the reviews of tourists guide us to where to eat good italian food. Besides for good service and wine the food was below average and extremely over priced (80euro pp). The truffle dishes were terribly salty, the shrimps not fresh, we sent them back. The whole night I suffered from heartburn from the plethora of butter in the cooking. In summary, you know the saying, when in Rome... Well here we didn't hear Italian being spoken.\",\n",
       " 'I give the food 3 stars (average) and service 1 star (terrible)...for an overall rating of 2.\\nMy fiance and I dined at Ad Hoc for our last meal of our 14 day Italian vacation. My 3rd trip to Rome. I did a lot of research and spent a lot of time choosing our restaurants for dinner. We were really looking forward to Ad Hoc on our last night in Rome. I now find it hard to believe all of the good reviews on trip advisor.  Before anyone books a reservation, I would urge you to read the less favorable reviews.  You will find 3 consistent themes:  Slow poor service, average food, high prices. \\nBased upon the reviews, I expected the service to be extremely slow. It was beyond that...we and the other tables around us went through long periods of at least 30 minutes without ever seeing a waitress. \\nA couple of quick notes:\\n1. The place is beautiful....very nicely decorated and comfortable elegant setting.\\n2. The food is very average.  I had the cacio e pepe, sea bass, and Italian cheese appetizer....none of the food was that good. My girlfriend had a pasta dish that was good...but not great considering all of the phenomenal food elsewhere on our trip.\\n3. The service is AWFUL.  We live in Los Angeles and I\\'m orginally from NY.  We are used to good and poor service in restaurants. I can even excuse poor service if the food is exceptional. That was not the case here. First, we were seated at the same time as 2 other tables with couples and provided menus.  I noticed the other tables were provided with wine lists but we were not. Waitress came by and asked if we wanted still or sparkling water...but no mention of wine.  I decided I would wait to see if she noticed.  30 minutes later she comes by to take our order....no mention of wine. 30 minutes later...appetizers come.  30 minutes later, appetizer plates are cleared. 45 minutes later main course arrives. At this point waitress asked \"Oh I\\'m sorry...do you want wine?\"  I respectfully declined.  \\nAn hour after serving us our main course, they finally clear the plates.  Another 1/2 hour goes by and nobody comes to our table to ask if we wanted dessert or coffee.  Finally, after more than 3 frustrating hours I politlely ask for the check.  After 15 minutes...no check!!!  So I finally get up and track down a waitress and ask again for the check. She responded very coldly...I\\'m trying to pay my bill!\\nTo be clear....we noticed the same situation occuring with 2 other tables around us.  One couple sitting at the table directly in front of us where clearly unhappy and uncomfortable with the slow service.  They were constantly looking around for a waitress. My fiance noticed a guy dining alone sitting directly behind me.  She felt bad for him because he was seated and then left at the table without anything for 45 minutes before a waitress came to his table. \\nThis was an overall regrettable experience. This place could be a great restaurant...but with bad service and average food and outrageous prices....there are PLENTY of better options in Rome. Save your money and find other options.  Beautiful place, but not worth it.',\n",
       " \"I reserved a table for 3 about a month before my trip to Rome because of the rave reviews on Tripadvisor. I am sorry to report back with an extremely negative review and I hope that I'm the only one who experienced this:\\n\\nWe arrived on time and was greeted by a lovely waitress and we told them who we were. It took them a rather long time to search for my reservation and seated us at the worst table possible in the entire restaurant - right beside a serving counter where all the dirty dishes were. We were looking at the back the entire night!! This became a major problem when we wanted to ask for the bill and in general got forgotten the whole night. \\n\\n1) We were in clear view of all the dirty dishes, the chaos, the drama and the waitress talk - all of which should be kept behind the scenes and not shown to us. \\n2) The time difference between us finishing our course and the next course took more than 30 minutes. When we finished a course, the dishes were also cleared about 20-30 minutes later, so we spent most of the time looking at time, trying to get their attention, waiting for them to clear our dishes, while they zoomed in and out of their counter oblivious to our increasing impatience.\\n3) I honestly felt that they could have given us a better table since I reserved a month to 2 in advance?? \\n\\nThe service and the waiting made the entire experience really miserable. It was such a nightmare trying to get their attention that we asked for the bill at the same time when we reminded them that we had a dessert that was not yet served. It is a pity that the lack of service has to ruin the chef's effort because the food there is pretty good but without the appropriate staff and amount of manpower, the restaurant just ruins the entire experience. I don't require the staff to smile and be exceptionally friendly, but the waiting and the inattentiveness really bothers me. \\n\\nI hope that the management will solve this and perhaps try not to seat anyone near the counter.\",\n",

I had to go through my emails for 20 minutes before they \\'found\\' our table. \\n\\nMore importantly, though, the food was disgusting! We literally left most of it on the plates. Mu husband had the \"Land and Sea\" tasting menu and I had the \"Roman Style\" tasting menu, both with wine pairings. I had such high expectations, but the food looked and tasted like over-salted, previously frozen left overs. My meat course was supposed to be Ham Roulades, but all I remember to this day are dried out discs of mystery meat on my plate. \\n\\nThe best part of the meal was the wine, but the food certainly wasn\\'t worth the effort.',\n",
       " 'Having had some really good food during our stay in Rome some meals costing only a few Euros, we decided to top off our last evening by visiting this restaurant which had good reviews on TA.\\nIt was a memorable evening, unfortunately for all the wrong reasons.\\nWe made a reservation an hour before, although they will have you believe the restaurant is so exclusive you must book a long way ahead. There were empty tables the night we went.\\nThe specialism at this venue is a \"tasting menu\" accompanied by wine with each course at a cost of between 79 euros and 129 euros. We went for this as the individual menu was also very expensive.\\nHaving been at the restaurant over an hour we had only just had our cold starter which although pretty to look at, tasted of nothing.\\nAlmost an hour after that we were served a pasta course which for me was 3 different variations on pasta carbonara. Again nicely presented but almost cold. I would have sent it back but couldnt catch anyones eye. Therfore most of it was left and when the waitress came for the plates I told her I was disappointed in the dish. She said she was sorry I was disappointed.\\nWe had been in the restaurant almost 2 and a half hours before the main course arrived by which time another party of 4 had left before finishing their courses. As only one of them spoke English or Italian they were at somewhat of a disavantage but were clearly unhappy and again there was a bland response to their concerns.\\nWhen our main course arrived I again said how disappointed I was with the experience thus far and that as it was now almost 10-30pm my appetite had waned. The lady serving said it wasnt her fault, they were at the mercy of the kitchen and chef so I offered to spaek personally to the chef, manager, owner, whoever was available. My offer was not taken up but several minutes later I was approached by another member of waiting staff who had come to tell me that my choice of desert was no longer available and would I like strudel. I declined and repeated my disappointment with the restaurant overall. She said she was sorry but the problem clearly lay with me as another customer had that evening had the same menu as I and he had enjoyed it and perhaps I lacked appreciation that all the food was freshly cooked. My response was that I could have cooked fresh carbonara in a lot less time than almost 1.5 hours plus and also produced it hot enough to eat.\\nShe seemed keen to engage me in an arguement which I declined and we left soon after having spent 3 hours and over 200 euros for a mediocre meal in a very pretentious atmosphere which showed you dont always get what you pay for. They deducted 19 euros from the bill in consideration of the desert being unavailable.\\nOn the plus side, the wine courses were good, not great but good and my husband said his beef was of the best quality.\\nIn summary if pretentious snobbishness with astronomical prices appeals more than good honest food then this is the place to go but there are far better places in Rome with better food and service at a fraction of these prices.',\n",
       " \"Living in Rome for almost five years, we have explored the Roman food scene and have truly found some gems. Over the years though, we have become somewhat complacent with our bubble of comfortable restaurants that we have discovered.\\n\\nNow about to move from Rome, I got curious and checked trip advisor to see what others had thought of our beloved restaurants. Surprisingly, most of the highest rated restaurants I had never been to. Seeing this, I got ever more curious: perhaps we had missed out on a whole series of incredible restaurants in Rome? We decided to find out.\\n\\nAd Hoc was our first challenge to our previous favorites in Rome. Me, my mother, and girlfriend were excited. Rated so highly on trip advisor, I was truly expecting something above and beyond the rest.\\n\\nThe evening started well. We walked in without reservations and were seated promptly directly next to the hostess’s desk where they make reservations. The waitress kindly welcomed us, and everything seemed to be going well. The décor was also deliberate, and designed, unlike most of the humble family restaurants in Rome, where you are likely to see the walls decorated with a mosaic of football memorabilia from Forza Roma and photos of Italian movie actors and actresses from the 50s. This was refreshing for Rome, despite the fact that it definitely felt a little forced. \\n\\nThe only disconcerting thing (so far) was the fact that there wasn’t an Italian customer in sight. A few English speaking customers surrounded us, and a German family was within sight in the other room.\\n\\nAfter being seated, we were all served complimentary prossecco. The bread was notably good also. Not a bad start at all. The menu looked exciting as well. It is uncommon in Rome to find a chef willing to experiment. The menu contained twists on local Roman classics, as well as a list of dishes with truffles used as their main flavor and inspiration. I ordered the “Ad Hoc” gnocchi, my mother ordered the cacio e peppe, and my girlfriend ordered the carbonara three ways. We also tried a few appetizers: Roman style artichokes, fried pumpkin flowers, and some fried cheese wrap.\\n\\nThat is where the romance ended. First, one wine we ordered tasted as if it were watered down. I don't know any other way to describe it. We are not exactly wine snobs, but this wine was genuinely awful. We ordered a different wine and it was better, but still bad. The third was decent.\\n\\nThe appetizers, all fried, seemed as if they had been fried earlier and reheated somehow later. One of the fried cheese balls was actually room temperature. \\nThe food, both appetizers and main courses, were lacking flavor. The textures were off. Everything was slightly warm, but verging on room temperature. Felt reheated. \\n\\nThe carbonara was very very sad, some of the worst we have ever had. Strange bland gnocchi. Soggy fried appetizers, caricatures of Roman classics.  The best was the caccio e pepe, which was below average. Everything was lacking punch. Depressing attempts at experimental. \\n\\nTo be blunt, the food was awful. Far below average for Rome, at above average prices.\\n\\nThey also had a bizarre ritual of checking the reservation book before letting people in, even though they obviously knew that there were plenty of open seats. A depressing performance art. \\n\\nOn the good side, the service was very attentive. Very helpful. No problems with the wait as other reviewers had described.. \\n\\nWhen we left, we were given a free bottle of prosecco. I am not sure if this because they thought we didn't enjoy our experience, but it was appreciated. \\n\\nOverall, this place is a tourist trap. There is a reason you don't see Italians here.\",\n",
       " \"My good friend and I decided to try Ad Hoc after many times of walking past after our full days of shopping in the city center. As soon as we walk in we were greeted by a sloppy and tacky shelf of magazines and books that hadn't been organized, dusted or paid any attention to it seemed in ages.  Ignoring this eye sore, we were seated in a tiny room with tables that were so close together that you could hear everything everyone was saying or doing and couldnt sit or eat comfortably. It was also filled with tired tourists, making the restaunt feel less genuine and more phony than one would want. Also, the room was lined with hundreds of dusty wine bottles that were very inconvienently placed at elbow level. So everytime you took a bite to eat you worried you were going to break an assumingly expensive bottle of wine. Also, to fetch a bottle of wine a waitress would have to interupt your dinner to manouevre it off the shelf. Because everything was so cluttered and cramped you felt you had to whisper and watch what you said during dinner so that the entire restaurant wouldn't hear your conversation. Not ok. So trying to ignore the tacky and cramped interior we had only high hopes for the food. The plates came out and  were very lovely, giving any reasonable person an expectaion of a delicious and gourmet meal. Every course was un utter disappointment. The food tasted like a any run of the mill restaurant, absolutely not worth the price, or even half the price. The portions were tiny and mediorcre at best though trying to be pretentious and superior. All night we had no idea who our waitress was and what language to speak to them in, as they kept mixing English and Italian. So to end a compete let down of a night I was brought the absolute worst tiramsu of all time. No exaggeration. It was disgusting. It tasted like watered down american coffee with a dollop of cream on top and soggy bread. I took one bite and pushed it away.  All in all this was a complete waste of money (as the food was insanely expensive), time, and of a perfectly good evening with a girl friend that could have been spent somewhere else more chic, tasty, authentic, and altogether more pleasant and comfortable. If you ask me, go somewhere else!\",\n",

Next morning I had an upset tummy.\\n\\nIt was our wedding anniversary, so they offered us a botlle of champagne, before we left, which was nice, but we're so dissapointed by that time, that didn't made the difference.\",\n",

I am still dissapointed about the choice we've made.Our dinner at this place was...well the right word for it would be BLAH... We have always dined at such wonderful places when visiting Rome before Ad Hoc. The atmosphere was very average and the way they seated people made it more uncomfortable. Do not even think to dress up for this one( even you think u r in Italy) it is very casual and reminded me of a coffee shop. I don't have anything bad to say about the service at our table, but nothing good either! They are really big on truffles on the menu, but that evening they were out of lots of things, so we did not have a lot to choose from.  The wine list is great tho. I did not see any managers on the floor, but the grumpy eastern European  looking man was very noticeable so as an owefully loud woman who was given the recipes to the guests next to us throughout our entire dinner. She was an employee or  my thought an owner and she was  really  loud to the point that I wanted to ask her to tune it down a little. Food was eatable and nothing to write home about till I got the cream brûlée. Instead of a nice and chilled on the inside and brown and crispy on the top I got Hot plate with Sprinckled  sugar on top.... My guess they just put it in the microwave instead of doing it the right way!!! Of course I didn't it touch it and we asked or the check. But no one even asked if something was wrong with it.

       " \"Visited Ad Hoc for NYE with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening. It was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of 190 Euros EACH. We arrived at 8pm and we're greeted with a small glass of prosecco, a nice touch but we then waited 1 hour for our starter and our first glass of wine. The starter was very average. We then waited 2 hours for our main and we we still hadn't had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine. The waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had 1 glass of prosecco and 1 glass of wine in 3 hours was just not good enough. The two couples next to us also asked for more wine.  One lady was literally falling asleep at the table. Two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake.  The main was again very average and cold. The 'sea' menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food. We complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further 30 minutes (at least).  The atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had 3 glasses of wine all evening so the New Year came and went without many people noticing. The couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight.  We had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types. Overall the service was average and very, very slow, at 380 Euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average.  We believe the Ad Hoc tasting menu with wine is normally 70 Euros and I think hiking the price up to 190 Euros per person was a mistake as the food, service did not live up to the price. We have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a NYE meal for the price they charged. We wish we had popped into a local Trattoria and enjoyed the fireworks and atmosphere in the Pizazza del Popolo. Incidentally, we had planned to watch the fireworks in the Piazza del Popolo but missed them due to the fact that the meal in the end took 5 hours! A very, very disappointing evening.\",\n",

The main course with meat was not good at all. We returned it to the kitchen. Overall the meal took 3.5 hours which was a lot of waiting. The restaurant was far too expensive for the value.

The restaurant at this point was empty and stayed that way at least to 8:15pm.

I ask nicely telling them we are on our honeymoon and all they said was 'so sorry' and escorted us to the door as if we were trying to break in. There was no manager (that I was aware of in sight) as I can't imagine they'd let this behavoir take place.

       " 'After a 10 day vacation in Italy we wanted to have a really special meal for the last evening (allthough I must admit our holiday was full of special meals...). Having passed the restaurant earlier in the afternoon my husband really liked the interior, and I liked that they had lobster w honeyglazed lemon on the menue, so we decided to eat there if they had a free table for us. Returning later in the evening we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and yes, they had room for us. Plenty of empty tables that evening actually (Sunday Nov. 7). Since we had been really overeating the whole trip, and I hadn´t read any reviews on this restaurant, we decided to just go for the \"secondi piatti\" and skip the antipasti. Well, good for us that we did. We did get the complementary sparkling white whine, and then went for the lobster on my part, and four try-out meat-courses for hubby.  I agree with others, the servings were really small, and our consolation in that respect was that we were in need of dieting anyway. Plates were cold, sucking the warmth out of the food. My lobster was pieces of lobster served on a square of cold, dry rice. Lobster was ok, as the strings of honey-glazed lemons. As a side order we had green asparagus with parmeggiano cheese; the asparagus wasn´t quite done so hard to chew, and the parmeggiano? Well, I am no expert, but it tasted like generic if there is such a thing when it comes to parmeggiano. Dry and tasteless! My husband\\'s glass of wine was more like one fourth glass, and measured digitally, mind you! We wew served a basket of bread with the food without asking for it, and really didn´t touch it, but lo and behold: they charged us for the bread!!! Not even in the cheapest joint! But here, oh yes, and 3 € it was! By the time we were actually finished and served the bill by the ever-sweet waitress and noticed this we could only laugh! Thank God for speaking an unusual language (Swedish) and being able to laugh and comment on this experience at the spot.  The whole time a v ery unpleasant unsmiling man (the owner?) kept lurching in and out from the back of the restaurant. At one point one of teh waitresses seemed to try to cheer him up a bit by wrapping herself intimately around him in the back room behind our table (my seating position made it impossible for me not to notice), but to no avail.

I am still dissapointed about the choice we've made.Our dinner at this place was...well the right word for it would be BLAH... We have always dined at such wonderful places when visiting Rome before Ad Hoc. The atmosphere was very average and the way they seated people made it more uncomfortable. Do not even think to dress up for this one( even you think u r in Italy) it is very casual and reminded me of a coffee shop. I don't have anything bad to say about the service at our table, but nothing good either! They are really big on truffles on the menu, but that evening they were out of lots of things, so we did not have a lot to choose from.  The wine list is great tho. I did not see any managers on the floor, but the grumpy eastern European  looking man was very noticeable so as an owefully loud woman who was given the recipes to the guests next to us throughout our entire dinner. She was an employee or  my thought an owner and she was  really  loud to the point that I wanted to ask her to tune it down a little. Food was eatable and nothing to write home about till I got the cream brûlée. Instead of a nice and chilled on the inside and brown and crispy on the top I got Hot plate with Sprinckled  sugar on top.... My guess they just put it in the microwave instead of doing it the right way!!! Of course I didn't it touch it and we asked or the check. But no one even asked if something was wrong with it.  We did not complaint and just wanted to forget about an owefull experience , but the top position on TA list of restaurants in Rome is just making me sad again.\",\n",

Although given a glass of prosecco when we were shown to our table, it took 35 minutes before we were served any food. \\nAsparagus Roulade was overcooked.\\nRavioli with Rabbit Ragout was very salty.\\nAd Hoc Gnocchi were hard in the corners and I could have made a better sugo.\\nSaltimbocca alla Romana tasted like reconstituted meat in a roll.\\nTiramisu was waterery and tasteless.\\nThe service was fauning and pretentious.\\nAlthough I left alot on my plate uneaten I was never asked why until the dessert.\\nAnd finally as we were leaving we were given a cheap bottle of Spumante in a brown paper bag to take away.

       " '10 of us ate on christmas day at Ad Hoc - we were seated in a seperate area which initally we thought would be good but ended up meaning we were ignored. One of our startes came and as we cut into the pasta dumping it was clear it was rotten (rotten fish is fairly easy to detect) we asked the waitress and she removed the plate without saying anything. our main courses came and they brought another of the starter, now without rotten crab inside but fairly empty because of it - still no apology. my aunt had eaten a piece before realising anything was wrong and was pretty upset about it.\\nthe rest of the meal was ok but very expensive and the service continued to be pretty patchy. we werent offered anything off the bill or a dessert to say sorry - really disappointed',\n",
       " 'We walked in with a ressie to an empty restaurant, but for one couple. They jammed us in corner next to them, so we asked to move. She said she \"had to check\"! It was absurd. They moved us begrudgingly, and we watched 3 couples get the same treatment. We did not like our food, and were disappointed.',\n",
       " \"Visited Ad Hoc for NYE with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening. It was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of 190 Euros EACH. We arrived at 8pm and we're greeted with a small glass of prosecco, a nice touch but we then waited 1 hour for our starter and our first glass of wine. The starter was very average. We then waited 2 hours for our main and we we still hadn't had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine. The waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had 1 glass of prosecco and 1 glass of wine in 3 hours was just not good enough. The two couples next to us also asked for more wine.  One lady was literally falling asleep at the table. Two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake.  The main was again very average and cold. The 'sea' menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food. We complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further 30 minutes (at least).  The atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had 3 glasses of wine all evening so the New Year came and went without many people noticing. The couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight.  We had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types. Overall the service was average and very, very slow, at 380 Euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average.  We believe the Ad Hoc tasting menu with wine is normally 70 Euros and I think hiking the price up to 190 Euros per person was a mistake as the food, service did not live up to the price. We have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a NYE meal for the price they charged. We wish we had popped into a local Trattoria and enjoyed the fireworks and atmosphere in the Pizazza del Popolo. Incidentally, we had planned to watch the fireworks in the Piazza del Popolo but missed them due to the fact that the meal in the end took 5 hours! A very, very disappointing evening.\",\n",
       " \"I can't comment on the food but the service was below par. We didn't have a reservation but it was still on the early side of dinner time. The restaurant had plenty of open tables however we were told they were full. When we asked about a reservation the next night we were told they were full for the next 2 nights, all this without looking at a reservation log book.\\nNeedless to say we didn't try to dine here again.\",\n",
       " 'We reserved a table through the website. This was very comfortable. We received a receipt. The atmorphere of the restaurant is very nice. The waitresses are very friendly, too. But it took very long until we could order. The gave us a complementary glas of prosecco. Overall the food was not really good except for the fettucine with truffels. The main course with meat was not good at all. We returned it to the kitchen. Overall the meal took 3.5 hours which was a lot of waiting. The restaurant was far too expensive for the value. After all the nice food we had in Rome in the small simple restaurants I would not go there again.',\n",
       " \"We had a reservation for 4 people, but was joined by a 5th at the last minute. As this was a child we hoped this would not be a problem. This couldn't have been further from the truth. \\n\\nThe lady that dealt with us could not have been less helpful, in fact she was bordering on rude and aggressive. If our request for an extra chair at the end of a table for 4 was so difficult for a restaurant to handle, fair enough, but at least decline our request in a polite, professional manner... Sadly not the case at Ad Hoc.\",\n",
       " 'With much anticipation we arrived for our reservation.  We were promptly seated, but then the trouble started.  It took nearly an hour for our order to be taken.  Sadly they were out of many menu items, including some featured in the hailed tasting menus.  Our dinner took nearly 4 hours with painfully slow service and most of the time with empty water and wine glasses.  Servers were completely inattentive.  I sensed that the entire dining room was annoyed with the poor service.  Food was OK, but several items on our tasting menu were cold and inedible.  Please save yourself the time and money.  There is absolutely no way that this is the best place in Rome.',\n",

I am still dissapointed about the choice we've made.Our dinner at this place was...well the right word for it would be BLAH... We have always dined at such wonderful places when visiting Rome before Ad Hoc. The atmosphere was very average and the way they seated people made it more uncomfortable. Do not even think to dress up for this one( even you think u r in Italy) it is very casual and reminded me of a coffee shop. I don't have anything bad to say about the service at our table, but nothing good either! They are really big on truffles on the menu, but that evening they were out of lots of things, so we did not have a lot to choose from.  The wine list is great tho. I did not see any managers on the floor, but the grumpy eastern European  looking man was very noticeable so as an owefully loud woman who was given the recipes to the guests next to us throughout our entire dinner. She was an employee or  my thought an owner and she was  really  loud to the point that I wanted to ask her to tune it down a little. Food was eatable and nothing to write home about till I got the cream brûlée. Instead of a nice and chilled on the inside and brown and crispy on the top I got Hot plate with Sprinckled  sugar on top.... My guess they just put it in the microwave instead of doing it the right way!!! Of course I didn't it touch it and we asked or the check. But no one even asked if something was wrong with it.  We did not complaint and just wanted to forget about an owefull experience , but the top position on TA list of restaurants in Rome is just making me sad again.\",\n",

       " \"Visited Ad Hoc for NYE with my husband and was very disappointed with the evening. It was a set menu with wine pairings for a set price of 190 Euros EACH. We arrived at 8pm and we're greeted with a small glass of prosecco, a nice touch but we then waited 1 hour for our starter and our first glass of wine. The starter was very average. We then waited 2 hours for our main and we we still hadn't had a wine refill so in the end we had to ask the waitress if we could purchase additional wine. The waitress gave us a refill but the fact we had to ask and had had 1 glass of prosecco and 1 glass of wine in 3 hours was just not good enough. The two couples next to us also asked for more wine.  One lady was literally falling asleep at the table. Two other couples were ordering espresso which we assumed was to help them to stay awake.  The main was again very average and cold. The 'sea' menu was mainly just deep fried fish and sea food. We complained again about the time it was taking and the fact that we had been without wine for a further 30 minutes (at least).  The atmosphere was awful and very flat as everyone was so frustrated and had only had 3 glasses of wine all evening so the New Year came and went without many people noticing. The couple next to us were still waiting to be served their main meal after midnight.  We had to complain twice about the time it was taking and the lack of wine which ruined the evening completely as we are not the complaining types. Overall the service was average and very, very slow, at 380 Euros for two it was completely and utterly over priced as the food at best was very average.  We believe the Ad Hoc tasting menu with wine is normally 70 Euros and I think hiking the price up to 190 Euros per person was a mistake as the food, service did not live up to the price. We have eaten at many nice restaurants and would have expected a lot more for a NYE meal for the price they charged. We wish we had popped into a local Trattoria and enjoyed the fireworks and atmosphere in the Pizazza del Popolo. Incidentally, we had planned to watch the fireworks in the Piazza del Popolo but missed them due to the fact that the meal in the end took 5 hours! A very, very disappointing evening.\",\n",

We showed up last night at 8pm all dressed up for our reservation when the woman kept going to the back of the restaurant looking it up again while seating other people. The restaurant at this point was empty and stayed that way at least to 8:15pm. It turns out in human error on my part after visiting 3 cities in 10 days I made the reservation for tonight at 8pm instead of last night. They refused to seat us! I ask nicely telling them we are on our honeymoon and all they said was 'so sorry' and escorted us to the door as if we were trying to break in. There was no manager (that I was aware of in sight) as I can't imagine they'd let this behavoir take place. I would also like to add that it was about 85 degrees last night and this place has NO AIR CONDITIONING. A part of us were relieved to not have to eat in that smoltering heat.\\nAfter eating a very lovely meal up the street (there are tons of great places to choose from). My husband wanted to walk by Ad Hoc to see if they were 'completely booked'. Although they were more crowded they definitely could have accommodated us. We're from NYC and I honestly could never see this happening there regardless of who made the error. I'm sure this review won't affect anyones desire to try this place, but hopefully it will affect the way their staff treats people.\",\n",
       " 'After a 10 day vacation in Italy we wanted to have a really special meal for the last evening (allthough I must admit our holiday was full of special meals...). Having passed the restaurant earlier in the afternoon my husband really liked the interior, and I liked that they had lobster w honeyglazed lemon on the menue, so we decided to eat there if they had a free table for us. Returning later in the evening we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and yes, they had room for us. Plenty of empty tables that evening actually (Sunday Nov. 7). Since we had been really overeating the whole trip, and I hadn´t read any reviews on this restaurant, we decided to just go for the \"secondi piatti\" and skip the antipasti. Well, good for us that we did. We did get the complementary sparkling white whine, and then went for the lobster on my part, and four try-out meat-courses for hubby.  I agree with others, the servings were really small, and our consolation in that respect was that we were in need of dieting anyway. Plates were cold, sucking the warmth out of the food. My lobster was pieces of lobster served on a square of cold, dry rice. Lobster was ok, as the strings of honey-glazed lemons. As a side order we had green asparagus with parmeggiano cheese; the asparagus wasn´t quite done so hard to chew, and the parmeggiano? Well, I am no expert, but it tasted like generic if there is such a thing when it comes to parmeggiano. Dry and tasteless! My husband\\'s glass of wine was more like one fourth glass, and measured digitally, mind you! We wew served a basket of bread with the food without asking for it, and really didn´t touch it, but lo and behold: they charged us for the bread!!! Not even in the cheapest joint! But here, oh yes, and 3 € it was! By the time we were actually finished and served the bill by the ever-sweet waitress and noticed this we could only laugh! Thank God for speaking an unusual language (Swedish) and being able to laugh and comment on this experience at the spot.  The whole time a v ery unpleasant unsmiling man (the owner?) kept lurching in and out from the back of the restaurant. At one point one of teh waitresses seemed to try to cheer him up a bit by wrapping herself intimately around him in the back room behind our table (my seating position made it impossible for me not to notice), but to no avail. He remained very serous end stern. Everytime one of the waitresses received money from a guest he popped out to take it and check the bill, so strange, and it semed our waitress was a bit uncomfortable with this. If so eager, why didn´t he do the charging himself? All in all, a total flop for the prices they charge. There are so many other good restaurants in Rome, so do avoid this one !',\n",

Moreover, the door is saloon-like, so that whenever someone used it, we enjoyed a complimentary cold draft…! We asked to be moved to another free table inside the dining room, but they refused: that table remained empty for the whole evening, they only used it for laying the leftovers of the nearby large company.\\nThe restaurant is also badly lit, with terrible energy-saving light bulbs (you could find better ones nowadays !).',\n",

They only have manti, khinkali and others from the same line of \"food thinking\". So are they specialized? Far from it. The taste is as blend as a fruit smoothie, the dough from the khinkali came partially raw and, apparently, they have quite a lot of oil to use in their food. Besides being fried (you expect it to be partially crunchy), the khinkali came soft and mushy. The taste of the filling is overpowering and strong enough to the point you can barely eat more than one fork of it.\\nThe aperitifs, though, seems to be much better, as the \"Mozzarella with tomatoes and basil\" came as good as you could expect for the price range (besides being quite oily as well).\\nThey are not \"internationally ready\" as the drinks menu, sometimes, has no english translation and the staff had a hard time understanding me and communicating, resulting in one dish coming wrongly. They are quite friendly and try their best, though. Had no problem changing the dish without additional charges.\\nHave I mentioned that even the dessert is oily? This place should watch out as Trump may give them some \"freedom\" for the oil.\\n\\nFor an almost 5 star rating restaurant on Trip Advisor, the fame might have overpowered them and the food quality came low as fast as the ratings went high. Or the peoples food taste is just dubitable.\\nWould I recommend? Not even if you have no money to eat, there are better (and healthier, considering the amount of oil they use here) fast foods and bakeries for the same price range. Would I come back?

The food was brilliant and cheap.  We had octopus and calamari cooked to perfection.  Not a rubbery bit in site.  There is no alcohol here which isn't a bad thing to cut back on once holiday.  BUT you must try the carrot and ginger drink.  Freshly squeezed/blended etc.  So refreshing, tasty and almost a meal in itself.  The staff were charming.  It also looked as though it is a great place for single people to eat.  We saw a few there happily alone and smiling.  Try it.\""
